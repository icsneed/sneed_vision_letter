            <p>Dear Community,</p>
            <p>
              Almost one year before the writing of this letter, <a href="https://sqbzf-5aaaa-aaaam-aavya-cai.ic0.app/" target="_blank">SNS-1 introduced a vision</a> for a fully on-chain, 
              community-driven Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). As a blank canvas provided by the DFINITY Foundation, 
              the community was asked to be the engineer of this first true web3 DAO — its fate steered by a collective spirit. 
              However, on June 13th, 2023, a new chapter for SNS-1 unfolded as the Dragginz team acquired it for their web3 MMO.
              While we may disagree with the centralizing of the Dragginz governance system, we are rooting for the success of Dragginz,
              like the rest of the ICP community. 
              Yet, as the final chapter of SNS-1 being a decentralized blank canvas concluded, a group of early SNS-1 community 
              members gathered to resurrect the original vision of SNS-1.
            </p>
            <p>
              SNEED is here to carry on the torch from the SNS-1, to form a DAO owned and led by the ICP community, 
              for the benefit of the ICP community. 
              The foundation of SNEED rests on five pillars: Security, Non-inflation, Eco-friendliness, Efficiency, and Decentralization, 
              which are made possible by the technology of the Internet Computer Protocol. The SNEED token will serve as the community token 
              of the DAO and the linchpin of the ICP community, and future communities to join SNEED.
            </p>
            <p>
              The general premise of SNEED is to act as a store of value, leveraging deflationary token mechanisms. 
              It seeks to provide a secure and non-inflationary environment for the SNEED DAO, completely decentralized. 
              Community members can create proposals for using funds from the DAO, further expanding the ecosystem or 
              hold the community token as a store of value.
            </p>
            <p>
              Amidst a rapidly evolving digital landscape, the journey ahead is filled with opportunity. 
              Together, as a community, we have the potential to pioneer, co-create and co-evolve a decentralized 
              digital realm that resonates with the core ideal of web3 — owned, and controlled by the community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mr. Sneed is asking You, the Community of SNEED users, to take active part in the future of SNEED. 
              Provide liquidity, develop dApps using SNEED as a token, vote on proposals, create memes, improve the design 
              of SNEED — anything, and everything that takes SNEED to the next stage on its pursuit of the decentralized ideals of web3.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the vision of SNEED.
            </p>
            <p>Best regards,<br /> Mr. Sneed</p>
